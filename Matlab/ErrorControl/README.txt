The program "main1" takes as input the maximum error and the error
type of error (MSE, L2, or L1), calculates the optimal "bins" and
"cut", returns the compression ratio, maximum error, and PSNR, then
recreates the data, and displays all 2d frames in succession.The code
is self explanatory. I put comments in "main1" indicating its various
stages. My purpose with the Matlab code is to provide a written
description of the algorithm.
