Minutes of Weekly Meeting of the Wavelet Group

Date: Wednesday, February 4th, 2015

Time:  From about 12:10 PM to 1 PM

Present: David Concha (remotely), Anupam Goyal, Drazen Fabris, Ed Karrels (remotely), Bonnie Smithson (remotely), Sergio Zarantonello

Presentations:

Serge went over his draft of slides for the GPU conference.  Ed started to go over his part, but could not complete it by the time meeting ended.

Discussions:

For Serge’s Part of the Presentation:

Drazen commented that there should be a slide in the beginning that explains the motivation for our work or answer the question “Why?”.  Thus, from a reference article that is a review article (to be searched for by Anupam), it should give current state of the technology, the scope of the problem, etc.  Anupam feels that it should give what contribution our work makes to advance the current state of technology.

For the slide titled “Error Control Loop”, Anupam suggested that the last point should be broken into two parts.  Drazen suggested that the part in this point - “error constrained by prescribed maximum”, should be put first on this slide and explained.

For the slide titled “2?D Tensorial Wavelets; Examples”, Drazen mentioned that this slide should explain what type of wavelet it is, what is the application of this wavelet.

For the slide titled “3D Procedure”, Drazen mentioned that the axes shown on the top right hand corner should be corrected, e.g. all three axes should be labeled and the axis appearing as “y” should be “z”.

Future Work:
Anupam should gather feedback from all of us about the slides.
