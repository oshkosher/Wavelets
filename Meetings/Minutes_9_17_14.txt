Drazen Fabris


Serge: Lustig, UC Berkeley, compressive sensing, MRI images, data compression~
Serge tried to contact, Anupam will continue
Talking to UT Austin.

Anupam: e-mailed former advisor, Stanford, two connections Xubin Zeng (Atmospheric Sciences, U. Arizona)
Compression: EOF and mode decomposition
NOAA data
Github and tasks

Serge: question whether lossless compression will be an issue re MRI, and other image examples

Ed: wrote an input and output routine to work with bits as opposed to full bytes
Did a half trip test. (Write out to a simple file, quantized and runlength encoded data).  
Error in the energy "metric". Multiply a+b and a-b by factor 1/square root(2)
to get Haar encoded data.

Comparing code with the matlab version of compression.  The current version does not produce the 
same results.  Question about the normalization 0-1 float, 0-255 bit range.

Quantization ranges: do we want only positive ranges for the bins or output?
Header will need to have the quantization and other information for reconstruction.  The header will need to hierarchical. 

New tasks:
Serge will write the abstract, prefers two presenters.
Anupam will look to at data sets 3-D versions, contact professors, tasks.  Handle testing.
Bonnie, quantization and comparisons with Matlab, determine where the differences come from.New log on status.

Ed, new spreadsheet as a text file.Read data in a streaming form.  Four letter names for each name for each part of the header.  Potentially use Google protocol buffers (faster and more compact that XML).  Will make a full trip, to disk and back.
Serge and Drazen, error control thoughts.
Student will join next week for 1-unit independent study.
