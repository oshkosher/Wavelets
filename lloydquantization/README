PREREQUISITES:
---------------

- CUDA


FILES:
-------

- src: Directory with the source code.
   |
   |- cuda: CUDA lloyd quantization.
   |
   |- oct: Cpp code to generate an oct file.

- Makefile: Building script that generates the CUDA shared lib and the oct file.


HOW TO USE:
------------

Runing make, the code insice src/cuda is compiled and linked using NVCC (CUDA compiler) generating the shared library liblloyd.so. 
Then the code inside src/oct is compiled with mkoctfile and linked using liblloyd.so generating lloydcuda.oct.

To use it, Octave must be able to find liblloyd.so, this can be done in many ways but the easiest probably is to copy liblloyd.so to /usr/lib.
